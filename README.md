# `CS50`’s Introduction to Databases with SQL

This repository contains my solutions for the problem sets in the CS50-SQL course offered by [Harvard University](https://cs50.harvard.edu/sql/2023/). The course covers various aspects of SQL and database management. Each week, I've completed the problem sets and uploaded my solutions here.
